<p id="p-intro">Initially, there were two unions. The Irish Football Union, which had jurisdiction over clubs in Leinster,
Munster and parts of Ulster and was founded in December 1874 and the Northern Football Union of Ireland, which controlled
the Belfast area and was founded in January 1875. The IRFU was formed in 1879 as an amalgamation of these two 
organisations and branches of the new IRFU were formed in Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Connacht Branch was formed in 
1900. The IRFU was a founding member of the International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby in 1886 with 
Scotland and Wales. (England refused to join until 1890.)
<br>
<br>
Following the political partition of Ireland into separate national states, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
(a political division of the United Kingdom). The then Committee of the Irish Rugby Football Union decided that it would 
continue to administer its affairs on the basis of the full 32 Irish counties and the traditional four provinces of Ireland.
Leinster (12 counties), Ulster (9 counties), Munster (6 counties), and Connacht (5 counties).

The Irish national rugby is coached by Andy Farrell and they play their home matches at Aviva Stadium
in Dublin. They currently rank at Number 4 in the World according to the IRB Rugby World Rankings. Ireland have competed at 
all Nine Rugby World Cups. They have only managed to make it to the Quarter-Finals in all but one tournment in 2007 where
they were knocked out at the group stages. It has become somewhat of curse that Ireland have never made it to an elusive
World Cup Semi-Final.
<br>
<br>
Aviva Stadium is their home ground. Previously called Lansdowne Road this stadium was built in 1872. The stadium had 
convenient public transport links as the Lansdowne Road station of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit rail system is adjacent to 
the site and passed directly underneath the West Stand. Lansdowne Football Club was founded in 1872 and that club has played 
rugby union ever since at the grounds, being one of the most prominent and successful rugby clubs in Leinster and Ireland. 
Wanderers Football Club, founded in 1869, joined Lansdowne at the grounds later. The two clubs were tenants since that time 
and also use the new Aviva Stadium. <img class="float-img4" src="assets/images/LansdowneRd.jpg" alt="">
<br>

Rugby gradually became the main use of the grounds. The first representative rugby match was an interprovincial fixture 
between Leinster and Ulster in December 1876 and on 11 March 1878 Lansdowne Road hosted its first international rugby 
fixture, against England making it the world's oldest rugby union Test venue. The first victory Ireland had at the ground 
took place on 5 February 1887, against England. The IRFU built the first covered stand in 1908, alongside the railway. 
An uncovered stand was built over the Lansdowne club pavilion at the northwest corner of the ground.
<br>
<br>
In 1927, the old East Stand was built and a terrace created under it. Soldiers of the National Army filled the stand to test
its strength. Unfortunately, the roof of the stand was not erected in time for the first match against Scotland. The day of
the match saw torrential rain, soaking the spectators and the day was long remembered for the appalling conditions. In 1954, 
the Upper West Stand at Lansdowne was built creating 8,000 additional seats. In future, all Ireland internationals were to 
be played at Lansdowne Road.
<br>
<br>
In 1977, the old West Lower Stand was demolished and the new West Lower Stand opened in 1978. The uncovered stand at the 
corner of the North Terrace was demolished and terracing extended. Lansdowne FC moved their clubhouse from under that stand 
to a new clubhouse within the grounds, near Herbert Bridge, beside the Dodder. The mock-Tudor tearooms of Lansdowne FC 
reverted to the IRFU. The East Stand replaced the Old East Stand in 1983, being financed by the sale of ten-year tickets.
This brought the stadium capacity up to 49,250, with 25,000 seats. In October 2005, a small fire in the north terrace put 
the terrace out of commission for all of Ireland's Autumn internationals. This meant that people who had travelled from as 
far away as Australia and New Zealand could not attend the match. The terrace reopened for the first game of the 2006 Six 
Nations Championship. <img class="float-img6" src="assets/images/Aviva_construction.jpg" alt="">
<br>
<br>
The last international rugby match before demolition was a 61–17 Ireland win over the Pacific Islanders on 26 November 2006. 
The last ever contest in the old Lansdowne Road Stadium was a rugby match that took place on 31 December 2006. This was
aptly named "The Last Stand" and somewhat fitting that the last ever rugby match to be played at Lansdowne Road would be a 
repeat of the first ever rugby match to be played some 130 years later. Leinster beat Ulster 20 points to 12 in a Celtic 
League game that set a record attendance of 48,000 for such a league match. Demolition of the stadium began in May 2007.
<br>
<br>
<img class="float-img7" src="assets/images/Croke_park.jpg" alt="">
During the construction matches were played in various stadiums around the country. Most notably Croke Park. Croke Park is 
owned by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), whose previous rules did not allow foreign sports to be played on their 
grounds. Croke Park is also a stadium steeped in history, briefly Ireland played home games here meaning it exceeded 
Twickenham in the rights of largest rugby stadium in the world with a capacity of 82,300.

<br>
<br>
Aviva Stadium was officially opened on 14 May 2010 with a seated capacity for 51,700 spectators. Ireland's first 
international game was on 6 November 2010 against South Africa, with the Springboks winning 23–21. In 2011, the stadium 
won a British Construction Industry Award. It has also hosted various interprovincial matches and also hosted The 2013 
Heineken Cup Final took place in the stadium on 18 May 2013 where Toulon beat Clermont Auvergne 16-15. The Heineken Cup 
final had last been held in Dublin in 2003 when Toulouse beat Perpignan 22–17 at Lansdowne Road.</p>
