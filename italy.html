<p id="p-intro"><strong>The Italian national rugby is coached by Interim Coach Franco Smith and they play their home matches at 
Stadio Olimpico in Rome. They currently rank at Number 14 in the World according to the IRB Rugby World Rankings. Italy 
have competed at all Nine Rugby World Cups but have never managed to progress past the Group Stages. A bit like Ireland's
plight with the Semi-Final. They still seek an elusive Quarter-Final.
<br>
<br>
Stadio Olimpico is their home ground and it it the largest sports facility in Rome with a capacity of 70,634. Similar to 
Twickenham and Aviva, Stadio Olimpico has quite a history. Construction began in 1927 with a partial opening in 1932, 
after a few variations to the original plan. In 1937, the construction of a second tier of stairs was started but was 
interrupted in 1940 due to the outbreak of World War II.

<br>
<br>
In December 1950, the working site was reopened for the completion of the stadium. At first, the plan was for a stadium 
with a more complex structure than that actually realised. However, the scarcity of funds and the environmental 
characteristics of the area led to a less ambitious building. On the death of Engineer Roccatelli in 1951, the direction 
of the work was entrusted to architect Annibale Vitellozzi. The stadium now reached a capacity of about 100,000 people, 
hence the stadium was known as Stadio dei Centomila, until renamed for the 1960 Olympics.<img class="float-img10" 
src="assets/images/Stadio_Olipico60.jpg" alt=""> The building was inaugurated 
on 17 May 1953 with a football game between Italy and Hungary.
<br>
<br>
During the 1960 Summer Olympics, the stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the athletics competitions. 
Seating at ground level was eliminated with the result of an actual capacity of 65,000 spectators. The Stadium has been used
for Football matches, the Summer Olympics, Athletics Championships and is the home of Italian Rugby.  From 1987 to 1990, 
the construction plan was amended several times, with a consequent rise in costs. Ultimately, the Olimpico was entirely 
demolished and rebuilt in reinforced concrete. This was done for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in which the stadium was the main
stadium and was due to host the FIFA World Cup Final. <img class="float-img11" src="assets/images/Stadio_Olipico.jpg" 
alt=""> In the end the new version of the Olimpico had 82,911 seats.

In 2007 a vast plan of restyling the internal design of the stadium was laid out, the work was performed and completed in 
2008.  It included the establishment of standard structures with improvements in security, the fixing of dressing rooms and 
of the press room. It also included the replacement of all seats, the installation of high definition LED screens, the 
partial removal of plexiglas fences between spectators and the field and a reduction of seating to the current capacity 
of 70,634.</strong></p>
