<p id="p-intro">The Scottish national rugby is coached by Gregor Townsend and they play their home matches at 
Murrayfield in Edinburgh. They currently rank at Number 8 in the World according to the IRB Rugby World Rankings. Scotland
have competed in all Nine Rugby World Cups the most recent being in 2019, where they failed to reach the quarter-finals. 
Their best finish came in 1991, where they lost to the All Blacks in the third place play-off.

Murrayfield Stadium or BT Murrayfield Stadium has a seating capacity of 67,144 making it the largest stadium in Scotland 
and the fifth largest in the United Kingdom. Built prior, Murrayfield offically opened on 21 March 1925 England were the 
first team to visit Murrayfield, with 70,000 people watching Scotland beat them to win their first Five Nations Championship 
Grand Slam. Murrayfield's record attendance of 104,000 was set on 1 March 1975 when Scotland defeated Wales 12–10 during 
the 1975 Five Nations Championship. This attendance stood as a world record until 1999.

The East stand was built in 1983. In October 1991 a redevelopment of the West Stand was proposed and started. The new West 
Stand was designed with a 48-metre cantilever roof. The old West Stand housed a museum, but this was not replaced and plans 
for a new visitor centre were shelved when the game turned professional. The first phase was completed in January 1993 with 
the new north and south stands opening. In February 1994 the centre section of the new West Stand opened.

The thoroughly modern stadium underwent a £50 million refurbishment in 1995, taking its capacity to 67,144. The ground is 
a tough place to play rugby, with inclement weather conditions often putting paid to the gameplans of visiting teams.
<br>
<br>
Murrayfield is used for most Scottish international rugby union matches, with all Scotland's Six Nations home games being 
played in the stadium. Murrayfield hosted matches of the 1991, 1999 and 2007 Rugby World Cups.</p>
