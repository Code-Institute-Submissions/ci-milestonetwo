# Rugby City Travel

![alt text](https://github.com/mattjboland/ci-milestonetwo/blob/master/assets/images/Avivastadium.jpg)

I had a big decision with this project. To do a travel website or create a game, both equally challenging and equally
difficult for a beginner like me. I can imagine like most developers even a novice like me, might find every project 
daunting. The more I think about things like this the more I think it cant be done. Being new to this I find the best way
is to plan and visualise what you want to create and get going. Delays dont help things but they cant stop you from 
achieving your goals. It is then quickly realised that anything can be achieved.

With that, I decided to challenge myself. After a brief deliberation I choose to do a travel website. I wanted to create
something that I would find useful and incorporate a passion. I know there are many similar people like me out there so I 
believe that this website will be of interest and benefit to many others like myself. Now I have a few passions in life 
some newer than others, like coding. Here I wanted to share my passion of travel and rugby. So with that I came up with
the idea of having a website that was informative and functional. 

I wanted for users to be able to see the locations of each stadium in each city. With the possibility of clicking on a 
choosen stadium and the results of various hotels popping up. This would give people an informative view of surrounding
areas but also give way for them to book hotels, flights etc. I also wanted to give a brief background into the Six
Nations Championship itself, with a little history of each stadium. It was very enjoyable for me as a rugby fan to learn
about each stadium and the history that goes with them. Like most travelling fans some will have no idea about was has
gone on many years before they travelled to the stadiums to enjoy a rugby game.

## UX
