# Rugby City Travel

![alt text](https://github.com/mattjboland/ci-milestonetwo/blob/master/assets/images/Avivastadium.jpg)

I had a big decision with this project. To do a travel website or create a game, both equally challenging and equally
difficult for a beginner like me. I can imagine like most developers even a novice like me, might find every project 
daunting. The more I think about things like this the more I think it cant be done. Being new to this I find the best way
is to plan and visualise what you want to create and get going. Delays dont help things but they cant stop you from 
achieving your goals. It is then quickly realised that anything can be achieved.

With that, I decided to challenge myself. After a brief deliberation I choose to do a travel website. I wanted to create
something that I would find useful and incorporate a passion. I know there are many similar people like me out there so I 
believe that this website will be of interest and benefit to many others like myself. Now I have a few passions in life 
some newer than others, like coding. Here I wanted to share my passion of travel and rugby. So with that I came up with
the idea of having a website that was informative and functional. 

I wanted for users to be able to see the locations of each stadium in each city. With the possibility of clicking on a 
choosen stadium and the results of various hotels popping up. This would give people an informative view of surrounding
areas but also give way for them to book hotels, flights etc. I also wanted to give a brief background into the Six
Nations Championship itself, with a little history of each stadium. It was very enjoyable for me as a rugby fan to learn
about each stadium and the history that goes with them. Like most travelling fans some will have no idea about was has
gone on many years before they travelled to the stadiums to enjoy a rugby game.

## UX

The purpose of the website project is to create a website aimed at rugby fans from all Six Countries involved. To provide
an informative and functional website catering to the needs of travelling fans or even hometown fans. On this website they 
will have access to locations of each stadium in each city of the participating teams. It will show precise locations of
each stadium giving the user knowledge of the surrounding areas through the use of Google Maps. Not only that it will
also show the precise locations of all the hotels in areas surrounding the stadiums. This will enable the user to carefully
choose hotels based on access and location that will suit their needs.

The website will also provide the links to each choosen hotel where they can explore the hotels and choose according to the
needs of each user. It will also provide links to other travel websites so they can choose flights that will help them
get to each destination. There will also be links to each homepage of each of the nations, where information on matches,
teams and much more will be available. With that, a hompage to the Six Nations Championship is included which will also
give the same information plus many more like tickets and competitions.

I also wanted to provide some information and history about the stadiums they fans are going to visit. Like me I have visited
many of the stadiums but never knew any history. I learned so much researching and even about the closest to me Aviva 
Stadium (previously Lansdowne Road). Some are much more modern than others but some dating back to 1872!! There is also 
information about each team and how they have performed in the Rugby World Cup, some better than others but it is 
interesting to learn.

On each homepage I also wanted to have some statistics displayed, about past performances in the Six Nations Championship. 
This was extented in 2000 with the addition of Italy so the statistics are from 2000 onwards. On a mentoring session
with Guido Cecilio he told me about maybe creating a dashboard to display some graphs and render the statistics. I had 
originally planned to have this on the individual team page but this made much more sense. So with his help we created 
the graphs.

**I used the following features on the website for the user to achieve these goals**

* Links to the homepage of each participating team
* Description of the of the Six Nations Championship
* Description of the purpose for this website
* Map to discover the location of the stadiums
* Map also to find and access the hotels surround the stadiums
* Link to a website to book flights
* Link to Six Nations homepage
